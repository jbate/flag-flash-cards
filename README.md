flag-test
=========
It's simple. We show you the flag, you guess the country. 

Flash cards for budding vexillologists if you will.

Try it out! http://jbate.github.io/flag-test/

How to use
----------
1. Page loads JSON list of countries
2. Tap the flag to reveal the answer (and capital city)
3. Double-click to show a new flag

Extras
------
### Jump to a specific country
Load a specific country's flag by appending their country code with a hash (`#`) to the URL.

So to view the flag for the UK, do this: http://jbate.github.io/flag-test/#gb

### Keyboard navigation
Use the &larr; and &rarr; keys to navigate to a new flag or back to a previous one.
And &uarr; and &darr; to toggle the answer.
